This is my guide to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) customization, aimed at helping users better utilize Docusaurus.

With the official release of [Docusaurus 3.0](https://docusaurus.io/zh-CN/blog/releases/3.0), it’s also a good time to update dependencies and refactor projects to make them more understandable and usable.

Feel free to use this theme, and if you have any questions, you’re welcome to ask in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/kuizuo/blog/discussions).

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
