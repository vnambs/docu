# HelloüëãÔºåI'm Jonathan Voary Nambinina

- <p className="inline-flex gap-1">üë®‚Äçüíª Online, I go by Jonathan (ÊÑßÊÄç). My avatar is [Cool Music](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%85%B7%E4%B9%90/18058703) <img src="/img/logo.webp" width="26" height="26" className="rounded-full" /></p>

- üßë A recent university graduate üêÇüê¥, currently living in Antananarivo and working for an IT Enterprise.

- üêõ I spent two years working with Easy Language and web scraping. During this period, I explored automation and reverse engineering. I now focus on JS/TS full-stack development and aspire to become a full-stack engineer.

- ü§Ø I love tinkering, possess strong self-learning and problem-solving skills, and have a significant code cleanliness obsession.

- üéÆ After my gaming account (QQ) was banned, I successfully kicked my gaming addiction and moved away from being a compulsive internet user.

- üí° I usually summarize my learning process into projects or blog posts and am happy to share with others. I find it very meaningful when others can refer to my projects or articles while learning these technologies.

### My Programming Journey

I met computers relatively late; I only got my first laptop after the college entrance exams. My first programming language was[Easy Language](/docu/blog/easy-language)Ôºå where I learned about creating plugins, reverse engineering, registration tools (batch), network protocols (with a focus on encryption analysis and web scraping), and automation scripts. Later, I developed a [Software](https://kuizuo.cn/blog/chaoxing-helper)friendly to college students, which caught the attention of a studio in Xiamen. This led me to take a break from school to start a business. After returning to school, my tech stack underwent a major transformation,[ shifting from reverse engineering to web full-stack development](https://kuizuo.cn/blog/2022-year-end-summary)„ÄÇ

Having lost interest in Easy Language, I needed a more powerful technology to support the creation of user-friendly applications. With some JS knowledge gained from reverse engineering, I chose front-end development. With cross-platform solutions, applications like web sites, desktop/mobile apps, and mini-programs are all manageable.

Perhaps due to my background with Easy Language, I've taken an unconventional route and learned niche technologies. I haven't systematically studied CS knowledge; my understanding of programming comes from self-practice and constant tinkering.

Now, with about 5 years of programming experience (2 years of reverse engineering + 3 years of web development), I feel somewhat jaded with web development and am looking to rekindle my passion. I might consider switching tracks to AI models, iOS development and reverse engineering, Rust, or hardware development. In any case, I want to stay busy and make each day fulfilling and meaningful.

### Hobbies and Interests

- **Electronic Music Fan**  My playlist consists solely of electronic music, and I only listen to electronic music. With headphones on, I immerse myself in endless beats. I aim to create my own electronic music in my lifetime.

- **Programming Development** Turning ideas into reality and enjoying the joy of creation.

### My Skills

- Easy Language Programming (I can write it but prefer not to due to poor development experience. I consider using other technologies as alternatives.)

- Windows/Android Automation Scripts, RPA

- Web Scraping / Protocol Reproduction (I prefer direct packet capture over automation scripts and prefer using TS over Python.)

- Code De-obfuscation / Reverse Analysis (Web JS can be tricky; stopped at the SO layer for Android and disturbed for iOS.)

- Chrome Extensions / VSCode Plugins (Should be able to create a more advanced demo.)

- Electron (Used to write but haven‚Äôt done so for a long time.)

- React Native (Can develop content-heavy mobile projects.)

- Mini-Programs (Can write but prefer not to due to poor development experience, specifically uni-app.)

- Web Full-Stack Development (Next.js full-stack development and Nest.js backend development.)

- AI Application Development (Currently working and learning in this field.)
