# Hello👋，I'm Jonathan Voary Nambinina

- <p className='inline-flex gap-1'>👨‍💻 Online, I go by Jonathan .</p>

- 🧑 A recent university graduate 🐂🐴, currently living in Antananarivo and working for an IT Enterprise.

- 🐛 I spent two years working with Easy Language and web scraping. During this period, I explored automation and reverse engineering. I now focus on JS/TS full-stack development and aspire to become a full-stack engineer.

- 🤯 I love tinkering, possess strong self-learning and problem-solving skills, and have a significant code cleanliness obsession.

- 🎮 After my gaming account (QQ) was banned, I successfully kicked my gaming addiction and moved away from being a compulsive internet user.

- 💡 I usually summarize my learning process into projects or blog posts and am happy to share with others. I find it very meaningful when others can refer to my projects or articles while learning these technologies.

### My Programming Journey

need to improve this section

### Hobbies and Interests

- **Electronic Music Fan** My playlist consists solely of electronic music, and I only listen to electronic music. With headphones on, I immerse myself in endless beats. I aim to create my own electronic music in my lifetime.

- **Programming Development** Turning ideas into reality and enjoying the joy of creation.

### My Skills

- Easy Language Programming (I can write it but prefer not to due to poor development experience. I consider using other technologies as alternatives.)

- Windows/Android Automation Scripts, RPA

- Web Scraping / Protocol Reproduction (I prefer direct packet capture over automation scripts and prefer using TS over Python.)

- Code De-obfuscation / Reverse Analysis (Web JS can be tricky; stopped at the SO layer for Android and disturbed for iOS.)

- Chrome Extensions / VSCode Plugins (Should be able to create a more advanced demo.)

- Electron (Used to write but haven’t done so for a long time.)

- React Native (Can develop content-heavy mobile projects.)

- Mini-Programs (Can write but prefer not to due to poor development experience, specifically uni-app.)

- Web Full-Stack Development (Next.js full-stack development and Nest.js backend development.)

- AI Application Development (Currently working and learning in this field.)
